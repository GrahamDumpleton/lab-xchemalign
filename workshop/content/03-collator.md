title: XChem Align - Collator tool
---

This page describes using the `xchemalign.collator` module tp collate the crystallographic  files into standard names
and locations so that they can be used by the next step.
The tool will be run in a terminal.

The result is the collated files plus a `meta_collator.yaml` file describing the process so far.
The user should be told to view this file and be given an overview of its contents.
The file is NOT to be edited by the user.

A list of possible errors and remedial actions needs to be described.

There could be an option at the end to view some of the files in NGLViewer.
