title: XChem Align - copier tool
---

This page guides the user through running the copier tool. This is running the `xchemalign.copier` module with
the appropriate arguments. The copying is done using `scp` (there is an alternative more manual approach).
The tool will be run in a terminal.

The result is the files required for the next steps being copied to the local filesystem.

A list of possible errors and remedial actions needs to be described.

There could be an option at the end to view some of the files in NGLViewer.
