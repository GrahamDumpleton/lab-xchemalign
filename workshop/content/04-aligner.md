title: XChem Align - Aligner tool
---

This page describes running the `xchemalign.aligner` tool that takes the files created by `xchemalign.collator`
and generates alignments corresponding to the different sites (typically one site, but sometimes more than one.
The tool will be run in a terminal.

The `xtalforms.yaml` and `assemblies.yaml` configuration files need to be generated prior to running *aligner*
and the user needs to be guided through how to generate these. Those files will be generated in the editor,
possibly with "smart insert" actions.

The result is the aligned files plus a `meta_aligner.yaml` file describing the process so far.
The user should be told to view this file and be given an overview of its contents.
The file is NOT to be edited by the user.

A list of possible errors and remedial actions needs to be described.
