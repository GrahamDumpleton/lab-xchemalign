title: XChem Align - Introduction
---

This page provides an introduction to the XChem Align process and tools, as well as expectations for
what's needed in terms of data and configuration to go through the process.
It is purely textual with no clickable actions.

Probably there are two version of this workshop. One with pre-prepared data where all the configuration is known 
up-front (acting purely as a training workshop), the second where the user provides their own data (where the workshop
is acting as a guided assistant).
